# Movie Tracker
This project allows users to sign in and save their favorite movies under their profile. It was made using The Movie DB API and Create-React-App. One of my favorite features of this project shows a 1.5 minute preview of a movie when you hover over the picture with your mouse. This app was designed based on Netflix's web design.


## Project Goals
* Pull in movies from Movie DB API.
* Login, sign up, and favorites pages utilize router.
* Can create new user, and sign in and sign out current user.
* Each movie can be saved to favorites and removed from favorites for that user.
* User can see a list of their favorites.
* User can see an individual movie (extension).
